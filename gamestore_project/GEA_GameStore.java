/*

GEA_GameStore program implements a GameStore called GEA that 
has some existing users "clients", and has the ability to add new ones. 
it has admins who manage the store e.g.(add, remove, and search for any user or game..etc), 
and it contains a lot of games of different genres that 
the user can interact with e.g.(buy, remove, send as a gift..etc).
